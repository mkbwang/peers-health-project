# Notes

## Questions about the ODG_Sample_Raw data set

* Why does ICD-9 has a date column(column G)? What is the point that every patient has multiple ICD-9 dates? 
* What is ICD-9-PC column(column R)? I cannot find it on google.
* There are 2 columns of _Date of Service_(column O and column T). Which one should I pick? What does _Date of Service_ mean in this context?
* There are 2 columns of _Number of Units_ column(column Q and V). What does _Number of Units_ mean? Which column should I pick? 
* There are two columns regarding treatment. One is _Procedure code_(column N), the other is _Other treatment code_(column S). Why are they separated? Do they belong to different coding system?
* What does the _amount paid_ column (column U) refer to? The sum of all the amount in one cell doesn't equal either the medical cost or the indemnity cost.
* Does the real dataset has the same structure as this mock dataset?

## Other general questions

* What does PEERS want from us? A report? A bunch of codes that fulfill their ML tasks of their data?
* I believe we need to make some form of presentation on Feb 15th for PEERS. What are we planning to present?
* How large is the dataset?
* How long will the project be? On the [PEERS WEBSITE](https://www.peershealth.com/university-of-michigan-rtw-intelligent-learning-research/), they say it is going to be 2 years. Will it be that long?
